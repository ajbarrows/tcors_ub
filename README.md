# UVM TCORS Usual Brand


- [ ] Determine whether information about a subject's usual-brand cigarette improves prediction of Week 12 cigarettes per day [Higgins, et al. (2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33079196/)
- [ ] Describe any univariate relationships between aspects of usual-brand cigarettes (e.g., nicotine content, perceieved strength) and Week 12 cigarettes per day
-  [ ] Select non-linear methods (ANNs) and, for each:
	- Provide background on the method
	- Build model using initial-split training/test data, with cross-validated training and (separate) cross-validated hyperparameter tuning
	- Directly compare this method's prediction performance with other models
	- Discuss any differences in performance
